The hapi pal discussion board

**Coordinator**: [Devin Ivy](https://github.com/devinivy)

This is a general discussion repository for projects under the [hapi pal](https://github.com/hapipal) umbrella.

## Guidelines

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/hapipal/discuss/issues/new) on this repository with your topic or question, providing as much detail as possible. The more we know, the better we can help.
* Be reasonable, helpful, and kind to each other.  Feel free to direct any concerns to the discussion coordinator listed above.
* Before posting, search the repository to see if there's already an issue opened to avoid duplicates.
* If you think something is a bug or a limitation, post your issue in the relevant repository first.  If you are not sure, you are in the right place.
